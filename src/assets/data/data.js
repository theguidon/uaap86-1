        text: " a gut-wrenching UAAP Season 84 Finals loss that dashed their hopes for a four-peat, the Season 85 Ateneo Men’s Basketball Redeem Team began their quest back to the pinnacle with a shaky first-round showing. As fans and pundits questioned if Ateneo’s dynastic reign was over, the Blue Eagles answered with unwavering grit and heart en route to reclaiming the title from their former usurpers.\nWhile the offseason arms race bolstered the cores of rival contenders, Ateneo remains the team to beat in the UAAP. At the helm of the Tab Baldwin-led squad are Season 86 Co-captains Chris Koon and Sean Quitevis, who are joined by a list of grizzled veterans headlined by Kai Ballungay and Gab Gomez. The Blue and White’s recalibrated roster also features a mix of incoming rookies highlighted by Mason Amos, Jared Brown, and Joseph Obasa.\nWith the upcoming season shaping up to be one of the most competitive in recent memory, the defending champions are heavily preparing for a slugfest. Carrying immense pride in their winning pedigree and underdog DNA, the battle-ready Blue Eagles will take the hardwood with sights set on staying atop the hill at all costs.",
